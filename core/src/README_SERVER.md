# Backend server

The server is built with FastAPI and is quite simple: there is just a single endpoint `/analyze` that receives an image and returns the predicted style scores, and the root `/` endpoint that returns "OK" as a healthcheck. The `/docs` endpoint is autogenerated by FastAPI, and it contains full descriptions of all endpoints, as well as allows to interact with them wihout a client.

## Deploying and hosting

The server is hosted using Azure Container Apps under <https://fashionpulse.icyglacier-6191089c.germanywestcentral.azurecontainerapps.io>. The following commands can be used to build the container image from scratch and to push the image to Azure. Note: all following commands are run from current directory.

Build a server image:

```bash
docker build -t fashionpulse .
```

Run the image locally to ensure it's working (note that to access the local server you should use `127.0.0.1:8000`):

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 fashionpulse
```

Login to Azure container registry:

```bash
docker login fashionpulse.azurecr.io
```

Push the container (tagging with url is required). To get login credentials, go to 'Quick start' in the browser. Enable admin rights in order to push the image. The image should appear under 'Services / Repositories'.

```bash
docker tag fashionpulse fashionpulse.azurecr.io/fashionpulse 
docker push fashionpulse.azurecr.io/fashionpulse
docker pull fashionpulse.azurecr.io/fashionpulse # make sure everything is ok (image must be up-to-date)
```

When logged in, to create a new version of the container, build with a new tag (and then push):

```bash
docker build -t fashionpulse.azurecr.io/fashionpulse:new-tag .
```

To deploy, create a 'Container App' or a 'Container Instance'.
